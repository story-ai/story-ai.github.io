          Story’s GCSE biology course is completely aligned to the essential
          subject content as set out by the Department of Education.  Each topic
          (Cell biology; Transport systems; Health, disease and the development
          of medicines; Coordination and control; Photosynthesis; Ecosystems;
          Inheritance, variation and evolution) is presented in the platform as
          a strand and each sub-topic is broken down further in to a nugget of
          bite-sized learning.

#### A GCSE in biology enables students to understand how, through the ideas of biology, the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas which are of universal application. &nbsp;Biological information is used to help humans improve their own lives and strive to create a sustainable world for future generations.

&nbsp;

Unlike other online learning platforms, all of Story’s courses are personalised to match your unique way of learning. The technology tracks your interactions and outcomes to effectively ‘learn how you learn’ - this way we can make sure you’ve always got the right learning materials for your learning style. Afterall, we all learn differently.

Our Biology GCSE course is curated by CENTURY’s Curriculum team of professional teachers to ensure content is aligned with the curriculum and that it addresses the skills and knowledge required by the Department for Education.
