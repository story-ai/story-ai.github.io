          Story’s GCSE biology course is completely aligned to the essential
          subject content as set out by the Department of Education.  Each topic
          (Cell biology; Transport systems; Health, disease and the development
          of medicines; Coordination and control; Photosynthesis; Ecosystems;
          Inheritance, variation and evolution) is presented in the platform as
          a strand and each sub-topic is broken down further in to a nugget of
          bite-sized learning.
