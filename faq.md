**What is Century?**

CENTURY Tech is our sister company and is the core technology that underlies the Story platform. It’s been built by the best engineers, scientists and teachers with one core mission; to improve learning outcomes for all. Students access learning materials on the CENTURY platform and data on their progress, achievement and areas for improvement are made available via an individual dashboard. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology, cognitive neuroscience and big data insights to provide students with a personalised learning experience.

**How are Story and CENTURY Tech connected?**

Story is the delivery of CENTURY Tech to the consumer market. CENTURY Tech’s licensed technology is live in 22 schools across the UK, with over 18k users. These successes are no longer reserved exclusively for schools; Story is making them available to everyone.

**What makes Century different?**

CENTURY is different to other learning platforms because it combines cognitive neuroscience, AI algorithms and big data insights. This revolutionary and truly adaptive technology is able to engage students by providing them with a personalised education.

**How do you protect our e-security?**

Century Tech is certified by the Department of Education as a cloud service provider and complies fully with the Data Protection Act. Our services use strong encryption for all interaction with our users, and all of our users’ data is safely and securely stored, encrypted and backed up.

**Is the content aligned to the national curriculum?**

Absolutely! Our Curriculum Team make sure that CENTURY’s content is aligned with the curriculum and that it addresses the skills and knowledge required by the Department for Education.

**How often should I use the platform?**

There is no minimum or maximum time for which CENTURY should be used.&nbsp; However, the more you use the platform, the more it will understand how you learn, and the more CENTURY will be able to personalise learning for you.
