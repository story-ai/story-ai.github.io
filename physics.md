          1. Understand how the use of models, as in the particle model of
          matter or the wave models of light and of sound.
        - >-
          2. Appreciate the concept of cause and effect in explaining such links
          as those between force and acceleration, or between changes in atomic
          nuclei and radioactive emissions.

          .
        - >-
          3. Understand how the phenomena of ‘action at a distance’ and the
          related concept of the field as the key to analysing electrical,
          magnetic and gravitational effects.
        - >-
          4. Appreciate that differences, for example between pressures or
          temperatures or electrical potentials, are the drivers of change.
        - >-
          5. Understand that proportionality, for example between weight and
          mass of an object or between force and extension in a spring, is an
          important aspect of many models in science.
        - >-
          6. Appreciate that physical laws and models are expressed in
          mathematical form.

          Story’s GCSE physics course is completely aligned to the essential
          subject content as set out by the Department of Education.  Each topic
          (Energy; Forces; Forces and motion; Waves in matter; Light and
          electromagnetic waves; Electricity; Magnetism and electromagnetism;
          Particle model of matter; Atomic structure; Space physics) is
          presented in the platform as a strand and each sub-topic is broken
          down further in to a nugget of bite-sized learning.

#### Physics is the science of the fundamental concepts of field, force, radiation and particle structures, which are inter-linked to form unified models of the behaviour of the material universe. A GCSE in physics enables students to understand how, through the ideas of physics, the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas which are of universal application.&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Unlike other online learning platforms, all of Story’s courses are personalised to match your unique way of learning. The technology tracks your interactions and outcomes to effectively ‘learn how you learn’ - this way we can make sure you’ve always got the right learning materials for your learning style. Afterall, we all learn differently.

Our Physics GCSE course is curated by CENTURY’s Curriculum team of professional teachers to ensure content is aligned with the curriculum and that it addresses the skills and knowledge required by the Department for Education.
