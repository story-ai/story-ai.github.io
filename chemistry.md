          1. Understand that matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms
          and there are about 100 different naturally occurring types of atoms
          called elements.
        - >-
          2. Appreciate that elements show periodic relationships in their
          chemical and physical properties.
        - >-
          3. Understand that these periodic properties can be explained in terms
          of the atomic structure of the elements.
        - >-
          4. Appreciate that atoms bond by either transferring electrons from
          one atom to another or by sharing electrons.
        - >-
          5. Understand the shapes of molecules (groups of atoms bonded
          together) and the way giant structures are arranged is of great
          importance in terms of the way they behave.
        - >-
          6. Appreciate there are barriers to reaction so reactions occur at
          different rates.
        - >-
          7. Understand chemical reactions take place in only three different
          ways: proton transfer, electron transfer, electron sharing.
        - >-
          8. Appreciate that energy is conserved in chemical reactions so can
          therefore be neither created or destroyed.

          This course follows the UK’s Department of Education specification for
          GCSE level chemistry.  Each topic (Atomic structure and the Periodic
          Table; Structure, bonding and the properties of matter; Chemical
          changes; Energy changes in chemistry; The rate and extent of chemical
          change; Organic chemistry; Chemical analysis; Chemical and allied
          industries; Earth and atmospheric science) has been broken down into
          smaller nuggets of learning. We think of these nuggets as bite-sized
          pieces of learning.

#### Chemistry is the science of the composition, structure, properties and reactions of matter, understood in terms of atoms, atomic particles and the way they are arranged and link together.&nbsp; Students taking this GCSE cousre will be helped to appreciate the achievements of chemistry in showing how the complex and diverse phenomena of both the natural and man-made worlds can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas which are of universal application.
