          1. Understand matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms and
          there are about 100 different naturally occurring types of atoms
          called elements.
        - >-
          2. Appreciate elements show periodic relationships in their chemical
          and physical properties.
        - >-
          3. Understand these periodic properties can be explained in terms of
          the atomic structure of the elements.
        - >-
          4. Appreciate atoms bond by either transferring electrons from one
          atom to another or by sharing electrons.
        - >-
          5. Understand shapes of molecules and how structures are arranged
          greatly impacts their behaviour.
        - >-
          6. Appreciate there are barriers to reaction so reactions occur at
          different rates.
        - >-
          7. Understand chemical reactions take place in only three different
          ways: proton transfer, electron transfer, electron sharing.
        - >-
          8. Appreciate energy is conserved in chemical reactions so can
          therefore be neither created or destroyed.

          This course follows the UK’s Department of Education specification for
          GCSE level chemistry.  Each topic (Atomic structure and the Periodic
          Table; Structure, bonding and the properties of matter; Chemical
          changes; Energy changes in chemistry; The rate and extent of chemical
          change; Organic chemistry; Chemical analysis; Chemical and allied
          industries; Earth and atmospheric science) has been broken down into
          smaller nuggets of learning. We think of these nuggets as bite-sized
          pieces of learning.

#### Chemistry is the science of the composition, structure, properties and reactions of matter, understood in terms of atoms, atomic particles and the way they are arranged and link together.&nbsp; Students completing this GCSE course will appreciate the achievements of chemistry in showing how the complex and diverse phenomena of both the natural and man-made worlds can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas which are of universal application.

&nbsp;

Unlike other online learning platforms, all of Story’s courses are personalised to match your unique way of learning. The technology tracks your interactions and outcomes to effectively ‘learn how you learn’ - this way we can make sure you’ve always got the right learning materials for your learning style. Afterall, we all learn differently.

Our Chemistry GCSE course is curated by CENTURY’s Curriculum team of professional teachers to ensure content is aligned with the curriculum and that it addresses the skills and knowledge required by the Department for Education.
