          As you learn, our amazing artificial intelligence (AI) technology will
          learn all about how you learn... It might be that you study better
          using videos, maybe good and simple text is best for you or perhaps
          you just need it said in a different way. AI technology will pick up
          on this and make sure that you’ve always got the right type of content
          to help you learn best.
