          Story’s GCSE physics course is completely aligned to the essential
          subject content as set out by the Department of Education.  Each topic
          (Energy; Forces; Forces and motion; Waves in matter; Light and
          electromagnetic waves; Electricity; Magnetism and electromagnetism;
          Particle model of matter; Atomic structure; Space physics) is
          presented in the platform as a strand and each sub-topic is broken
          down further in to a nugget of bite-sized learning.

#### Physics is the science of the fundamental concepts of field, force, radiation and particle structures, which are inter-linked to form unified models of the behaviour of the material universe. A GCSE in physics enables students to understand how, through the ideas of physics, the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas which are of universal application.

&nbsp;

Story approaches learning, by enabling the learner to set their own pace and direction. &nbsp;As we all learn differently, we have created a platform that builds a learning pathway for each individual. &nbsp;This unique learning experience is created using AI and Big data technology to analyse, evaluate and adapt how and when you are presented with the learning materials.&nbsp;

<br>CENTURY’S has a team of full time teachers. &nbsp;They design engaging GCSE courses, using their subject knowledge and experience of what actually works for learners. Whilst always aligning course content and learning objectives to the curriculum set out by the Department for Education.
