          Story’s GCSE English Literature courses are completely aligned to the
          essential subject content, each topic (detailed study, reading
          comprehension and reading critically, writing) has been broken down
          into smaller nuggets of learning. We think of these nuggets as

#### Our English Language GCSE courses comprehensively cover the curriculum with individual courses for each of the topic areas. Students can focus in on one topic such as creative writing, or mix and match with topics from the subject area.

Created by professional teachers who have a deep understanding of the subject and curriculum, this course has been designed to get you as exam ready as possible.

And like all courses on Story, our powerful software will tailor the content around your learning style. At the beginning of the course, you’ll take a quick diagnostic test to determine your current level and then throughout the course you’ll be given the opportunity to test your skills with questions and quizzes, each strengthening your knowledge and understanding.
