          This course follows the UK’s Department of Education specification for
          GCSE level mathematics.  Each topic (Number, Algebra, Ratio,
          Proportion and rates of change, Geometry and measures, Probability,
          Statistics) has been broken down into smaller nuggets of learning. We
          think of these nuggets as bite-sized pieces of learning.
